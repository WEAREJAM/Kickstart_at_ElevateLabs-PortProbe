19This is the basic task of checking our local network for vulnerable ports. The ports are the most searched and most found vulnerabilities if they are not secured. 

There are 65535 ports. 
Well-Known Ports - 0 to 1023
Registered Ports - 1024 to 49151
Private Ports - 49152 to 65535

#Tools Usage 
Nmap is a powerful tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It detects open ports, services, OS versions, IP addresses, and can perform vulnerability scans using NSE scripts.

Task 1:
Local network scan with NMAP
To check the ports available in our network, lets spin our kali linux in our VMware. Lets open terminal and run ip a 
ip a -> This command shows our ipaddress, where we now get the subnet and perform the nmap scan
lets say my ip is 192.168.45.1 and my subnet will be 192.168.45.0/24

Now run the nmap, here i am using nmap in terminal we can also use zenmap for the scans.
nmap -sS 192.168.45.0/24
